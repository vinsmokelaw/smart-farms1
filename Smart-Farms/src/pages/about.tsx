              Smart Farms is an enterprise committed to using innovation to  ensure food security, improve livelihoods, and transform rural  communities through precision agriculture solutions in Zimbabwe.  We take advantage of advanced high resolution camera drones  embedded with smart sensors for land mapping, surveying, crop  health monitoring, and pesticide and fertilizer applications. Our  actions contribute to positive climate change, and we are on a goal to  end poverty and hunger. We want to help smallholders and medium  scale farmers realize their value to the economy of the country  through their agricultural harvests.

             “The agricultural sector in Zimbabwe contributes about 21% towards the  country’s GDP. Out of this, more than 50% comes from smallholder and  medium scale farmers yet they are still relying on traditional methods of  farming that are so outdated, imprecise and labor intensive. Clearly,  smallholder and medium scale farmers are under-represented as they have  the potential to contribute so much to the country’s economy.  As someone who grew up in a farming community, I have witnessed  firsthand the struggles of my family and neighbors, losing crops to  unpredictable weather, pest attacks, and the sheer exhaustion of manual  labor. I’ve watched hard-working farmers struggle to make a living, not  because they lack knowledge or effort, but because they lack access to  modern tools and technologies that could revolutionize their productivity.  Smart Farms was born out of my desire to change this narrative. By  integrating drone technology into agriculture, we are creating a future where  farmers can monitor crops, apply inputs with precision, and make data driven decisions—all with minimal effort and maximum impact. Our mission  is to empower these farmers, increase food security, and promote  sustainable farming practices.  I believe that with the right support and innovation, smallholder farmers will  no longer be left behind. They will become the backbone of a technologically  empowered and thriving agricultural economy”
