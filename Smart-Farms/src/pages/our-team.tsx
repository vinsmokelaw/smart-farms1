          At Smart Farms, we are more than just a team, we are a movement of
          passionate, young innovators committed to transforming agriculture
          through technology. Our team is proudly youth-led, driven by a deep
          understanding of the challenges faced by small-scale farmers and a
          bold vision to create smarter, more sustainable solutions for the
          future. We believe that youth are not just the leaders of tomorrow,
          they are the changemakers of today. Our dynamic team brings together
          fresh ideas, technical expertise, and a strong sense of purpose to
          bridge the gap between traditional farming and the digital age. We are
          also proud of our gender-diverse team, made up of one male and two
          females, working side by side to challenge norms and ensure inclusive
          innovation in agriculture. Our diversity is our strength, helps us see
          problems differently, build empathy with the communities we serve, and
          co-create solutions that are practical and impactful.
